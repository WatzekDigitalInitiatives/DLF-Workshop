    - **Copy** the `xx.xx.xx.xx` number under *Public IP* column of your row
    - **Paste** it at the end of the command you just typed
    - You command should look like: `ssh -i dlf-workshop-key.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx`
    - Hit **return** to connect
    - If it prompts you `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?` type `yes` and hit **return**
